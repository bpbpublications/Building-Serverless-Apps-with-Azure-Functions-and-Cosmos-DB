# Building Serverless Apps with Azure Functions and Cosmos DB

Leverage Azure functions and Cosmos DB for building serverless applications

This is the repository for [Building Serverless Apps with Azure Functions and Cosmos DB](https://bpbonline.com/products/building-serverless-apps-with-azure-functions-and-cosmos-db?_pos=1&_sid=9c932af9e&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications.

## About the Book
This book provides examples to start with Azure functions and Azure Cosmos DB. It demonstrates the features available in both of the mentioned Azure services and discusses them in detail with some real-world examples. Reading a csv file and write to a Cosmos DB table store,  Read emails using Microsoft Graph API and save them in a Cosmos DB, Cosmos DB trigger function to send SMS notifications to clients, A queue trigger to create new nodes in the Cosmos DB graph data store are some of them.  You will be able to see the above case studies with code samples implemented in C# .NET Core, TypeScript, and Python. It consists of a very basic example, two intermediate samples, then and an advanced level one.

You will experience the triggers and input/output bindings available for a function, like queue trigger, blob trigger, and Cosmos DB trigger to name a few. Also, you will be able to see some interesting features available in Azure functions like performance optimizations, scalability of a function app, geographical distribution of the function in different locations, error handling, writing unit tests for the functions to avoid breaking changes, how to ensure a function app is secure, and then how to deploy a function, and monitor and troubleshoot a function app.

At the end of this book, you will gain strong experience in using Azure functions and how to manage serverless applications seamlessly without any failure with utmost performance.

## What you will learn
* You will be able to create an Azure function and integrate it with many Azure services including the Azure Cosmos DB
* You will get experience implementing a function using programming languages like C# .NET Core, TypeScript, and Python.
* You will get hands-on experience on the performance optimizing of a function, how to scale them, how to apply security to the function app, error handling and testing in a function.
